# sentiment-analysis-application
In this project, I did sentiment analysis using Logistic Regression. I wrote all of the code from scratch. 

Sentiment Analysis or opinion mining is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is postive, negative or netural. Sentiment Analysis is often performed on textual context data to help business monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback and understand customer needs. 

## Project Details
The project is divided into three parts that are:
1. Building our sentiment analysis model.
2. Building a web application on which we can mount our model. 
3. Lastly deploying the web application on Heroku.
