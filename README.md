# sentiment-analysis-application
In this project, I did sentiment analysis using Logistic Regression. I wrote all of the code from scratch. 

Sentiment Analysis or opinion mining is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is postive, negative or netural. Sentiment Analysis is often performed on textual context data to help business monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback and understand customer needs. 

## Project Details

1. Building our sentiment analysis model.
2. Building a web application on which we can mount our model. 
3. Lastly deploying the web application on Heroku. 


## Technology
1. Python
2. NLTK
3. Sklearn
4. Django

## Run
1. Create the copy of the project.
2. Open command prompt and change your current path to folder where you can find `app.py` file.
3. Create environment by command given below -$ `conda create -name <environment name>`
4. Activate environment by command as follows - $ `conda activate <environment name>`
5. Use command below to install required dependencies - $ `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run application by command - $ `python manage.py runserver`. You will get url copy it and paste in browser.
